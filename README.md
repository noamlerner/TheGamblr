# The Gamblr

_Legend has it that this entire codebase was written in one playthrough
of [The Gambler by Kenny Rogers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hx4gdlfamo)_

...Those who know the author know he probably just put it on repeat for the whole time.

## Intro

_You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em_

This is a poker engine written to allow people to pit algorithms against each other. While this engine is written in Go,
it allows its users to use any language they want by creating a GRPC interface through which the game will be
played.

The GRPC interface can be found in the ./proto folder with plenty of comments.

An example client can be found in the client folder.

More in depth readme to come.
